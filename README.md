# lazo
Lazo, a theme based on [Casper](https://github.com/TryGhost/casper), [Ghost's](https://ghost.org) default personal blogging theme. 

The main difference between Lazo and Casper lies in the details:
* A home button was (re-)added to the upper left -- as it was present in the early Casper versions.
* The font of the menu was changed to a non-serif font
* Addition of Disqus
